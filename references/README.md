This document describes the teaching plan, architecture and development history of egos-2000.

## Teaching plan (EGOS + EGOS2000)

We use EGOS to teach our Practicum in Operating Systems (CS4411) at Cornell, a 2-credit course focusing solely on projects.
There are five mandatory projects:

|    | Description                     | Concepts to teach                                           | Platform  |
|----|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| P0 | Queue                           | memory, pointer, instruction and stack pointers             | Linux/Mac |
| P1 | User-level threading            | thread, context switch, synchronization                     | Linux/Mac |
| P2 | Multi-level feedback queue      | timer and quantum, scheduling, priority                     | Linux/Mac |
| P3 | Memory management               | control register, exception handling, privilege level       | Arty FPGA |
| P5 | File system                     | inode layer, directory layer, layered file system           | Arty FPGA |

And some optional projects:
|    | Description                     | Concepts to teach                                                  | Platform  |
|----|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| P4 | SD card driver                  | I/O bus, memory-mapped bus controller, device driver               | Arty FPGA |
| P6 | Networking                      | IP layer (Ethernet driver with SPI), transportation layer (UDP)    | Arty FPGA |
| P7 | Graphic user interface          | VGA driver with GPIO ([example](https://digilent.com/reference/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/arty-pmod-vga-demo/start))                        | Arty FPGA |

## Architecture

**Earth layer (hardware specific)**
* `earth/dev_disk`: SD card (touched by P4)
* `earth/dev_tty`: keyboard input and tty output
* `earth/cpu_intr`: interrupt and exception handling (touched by P3)
* `earth/cpu_mmu`: memory paging and address translation (touched by P3)

**Grass layer (hardware independent)**
* `grass/timer`: control timer registers
* `grass/process`: manage process data structures (touched by P1)
* `grass/scheduler`: preemptive scheduling and inter-process communication (touched by P2)

**Application layer**
* `app/system/proc_file`: manage an inode layer on the SD card (touched by P5)
* `app/system/proc_dir`: manage the directory layer on top of inode layer (touched by P5)
* `app/system/proc_shell`: interactive user interface
* user commands: `pwd`, `clear`, `killall`, `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `clock`

Every layer has a dedicated memory region as described below (and in `library/egos.h`). The complete memory layout is described in Chapter 4 of the FE310 manual in this repository.
